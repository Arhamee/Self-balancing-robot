ðŸ¤– Self-Balancing Arduino Robot
A self-balancing robot built using an Arduino microcontroller. Inspired by the concept of inverted pendulums, this robot uses sensor feedback and PID control to maintain balance on two wheels.

ðŸ“¸ Project Overview
The self-balancing robot utilizes:

An Arduino Uno (or similar) as the main controller.
A MPU6050 (gyroscope + accelerometer) for measuring tilt.
DC motors with encoders and an H-bridge motor driver (e.g., L298N).
A PID algorithm to adjust motor speed based on tilt angle.
This project is great for learning about control systems, sensor integration, and real-time programming with Arduino.
